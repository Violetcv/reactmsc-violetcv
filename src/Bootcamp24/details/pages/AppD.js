                The focus will be on mobile app development,
                starting with an introduction to either Android
                (Java/Kotlin) or iOS (Swift) development. Participants
                may also learn cross-platform development using tools
                like Flutter or React Native. Key topics include UI/UX
                design principles, state management, local storage,
                and API integration. The bootcamp will also cover testing,
                debugging, and optimizing mobile apps.
