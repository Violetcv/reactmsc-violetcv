                Participants will delve into the fundamentals of
                artificial intelligence and machine learning,
                starting with Python programming for data science,
                using libraries like Pandas and NumPy. The curriculum
                includes data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn,
                understanding supervised and unsupervised learning
                algorithms, and evaluating and tuning models.
                The bootcamp will also introduce deep learning with
                frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras, along with
                practical experience working with datasets.
