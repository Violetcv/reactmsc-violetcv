                This domain will introduce participants to augmented reality
                (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies. They will learn
                to use tools like Unity or Unreal Engine for creating immersive
                experiences. Topics include building 3D models and environments,
                scripting with C# or Blueprints, and handling user interactions
                in AR/VR settings. Participants will also learn about testing
                and deploying AR/VR applications.
